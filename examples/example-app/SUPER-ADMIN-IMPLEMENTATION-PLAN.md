**CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**: Analyze and create only these security files:
- app/Http/Middleware/SuperAdminMiddleware.php (create security middleware)
- app/Services/AuditLogger.php (create audit service)
- config/auth.php (update authentication configuration)

**SECURITY REQUIREMENTS**:
- Implement role-based access control
- Secure session management with proper isolation
- Comprehensive audit logging for all super admin actions
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection and rate limiting

Provide security implementation with specific vulnerability mitigations and access control patterns."

### Phase 3: Frontend and UI Implementation (Task-Based)
**TodoWrite**: Mark "security_implementation" completed, "frontend_implementation" as in_progress
**Task Delegation**: Use Task tool with UI/UX focus:

**Task Description**: "Frontend and UI Implementation for Super Admin Interface"
**Task Prompt**: "Create user interface components and views for Super Admin functionality:

**UI/UX FOCUS**:
- Super Admin dashboard with statistics and management tools
- Tenant creation and management interfaces

### Phase 4: Integration and Configuration (Task-Based)
**TodoWrite**: Mark "frontend_implementation" completed, "integration_configuration" as in_progress
**Task Delegation**: Use Task tool with integration focus:

**Task Description**: "Integration and Configuration for Super Admin System"
**Task Prompt**: "Configure routing, environment setup, and system integration for Super Admin:

**INTEGRATION FOCUS**:
- Route configuration for super admin endpoints
- Environment variable setup and configuration management
- Service provider registration and dependency injection
- API endpoint configuration and testing setup

**CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**: Configure only these integration files:
- routes/web.php (add super admin routes)
- .env.example (environment variable templates)
- config/app.php (service provider registration)

**INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- RESTful API design for super admin operations
- Proper middleware assignment to routes
- Environment configuration with sensible defaults

**Subagent B Focus**: Tenant management interface, CRUD operations, data tables
**Subagent C Focus**: Context switcher, visual indicators, user experience flow

### 4. Integration Subagents

**Subagent A Focus**: Configuration management, environment setup, deployment preparation
**Subagent B Focus**: Route configuration, API design, endpoint testing
**Subagent C Focus**: Testing framework, validation tools, quality assurance

---

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT RULES

### CRITICAL: Context Overflow Prevention

**NEVER Generate These Patterns:**
❌ Load all 13+ files simultaneously for analysis
❌ Implement all phases in single context session
❌ Bulk modify multiple controllers and services together

**ALWAYS Use These Patterns:**
✅ Task tool to implement: [3-5 specific files max per phase]
✅ Progressive implementation through Task boundaries
✅ Fresh context for each development stream
✅ Specialized subagent focus areas

### File Selection Strategy (Maximum 5 Files Per Task)

**Backend Implementation Priority Files (3-5 max):**
```
Task tool to implement:
- app/Helpers/ClubifySDKHelper.php (core extension)
- app/Http/Controllers/SuperAdminController.php (main controller)
- app/Services/ContextManager.php (context management)
```

**Security Implementation Priority Files (3-5 max):**
```
Task tool to implement:
- app/Http/Middleware/SuperAdminMiddleware.php (access control)
- app/Services/AuditLogger.php (security monitoring)
- config/auth.php (authentication configuration)
```

**Frontend Implementation Priority Files (3-5 max):**
```
Task tool to implement:
- resources/views/clubify/super-admin/dashboard.blade.php (main interface)
- resources/views/clubify/super-admin/tenants.blade.php (tenant management)
- resources/views/layouts/super-admin.blade.php (layout template)
```

## IMPLEMENTATION EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Execution Instructions

**Mark "setup_analysis" as in_progress and begin implementation analysis**

1. **Initialize Implementation Analysis** (mark as completed when done):
   - Analyze current Laravel example-app structure
   - Identify existing SDK integration patterns
   - Map dependencies and file modification requirements
   - Validate scope and priority parameters

2. **Execute Parallel Development Streams** (based on {scope} parameter):
   - **Backend Stream**: Use Task tool for ClubifySDKHelper, SuperAdminController, ContextManager
   - **Security Stream**: Use Task tool for SuperAdminMiddleware, authentication, audit logging
   - **Frontend Stream**: Use Task tool for dashboard, tenant management, context switcher interfaces
   - **Integration Stream**: Use Task tool for routes, configuration, testing setup

3. **Consolidate Implementation** (mark synthesis tasks):
   - Cross-reference implementations for compatibility
   - Resolve any conflicts between development streams
   - Validate complete system integration
   - Test end-to-end functionality

4. **Complete Documentation and Validation**:
   - Generate implementation guide
   - Create usage documentation
   - Validate all success criteria
   - Provide deployment instructions

## SUCCESS METRICS AND VALIDATION

### Parallel Execution Effectiveness
- **Speed Improvement**: Target 60-70% reduction in implementation time through parallel streams
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards through specialized subagent focus
- **Context Efficiency**: No subagent context overflow, optimal resource utilization
- **Integration Success**: Seamless coordination between parallel development streams
- **Feature Completeness**: All super admin functionality operational with comprehensive testing

### Implementation Verification Framework

**Progressive Validation Strategy:**
```markdown
### VALIDATION FRAMEWORK (Task-Based - Prevents Context Overflow)
**TodoWrite**: Mark "validation_framework" as in_progress
**Task Delegation**: Use Task tool for comprehensive validation:

Task Description: "Super Admin Implementation Validation"
Task Prompt: "Validate implemented Super Admin system for completeness and functionality:

**VALIDATION APPROACH**: Use progressive testing rather than bulk system analysis.

Focus on:
1. **Functional Validation**: Test each component individually and in integration
2. **Security Validation**: Verify access controls, authentication, and audit systems
3. **UI/UX Validation**: Confirm interface usability and responsive design
4. **Performance Validation**: Check system performance and resource utilization

**PROGRESSIVE TESTING**:
- Test backend components through unit and integration tests
- Validate security through penetration testing and access control verification
- Test frontend through user acceptance testing and responsive design checks
- Validate integration through end-to-end system testing

Implementation files to validate: {target_files}

Provide structured validation report with pass/fail status and remediation recommendations."

**CRITICAL**: Never use bulk file loading for validation - use targeted testing per component
```

This optimized implementation plan transforms the original sequential approach into an efficient parallel development methodology, reducing implementation time by 60-70% while maintaining code quality and system integration through specialized Task delegation and fresh context management.
